Project 02
ACCORD CHAT
Members:  Michael Cheng, Ricky Chen, Edmond Wong

PROJECT DESCRIPTION
Our project will allow you to interact with your desired community, over a server in a lobby. 
You can text chat or share files using Accord Chat. You can also play a minigame with lobby members, with the option of tic-tac-toe
or hangman.

USAGE DESCRIPTION
Accord Chat is a TUI program, using ncurses to achieve this. There is a single text input line, and special commands are activated using !<command>.
For example, !tictactoe <player name> would start the tic-tac-toe minigame with your desired player.

TECHNICAL DESIGN
Our project will draw from numerous topics learned this semester. We will need to work with files in order to share them.
We will use forking extensively, in order to make subservers for lobbies, and subservers of those to interact with the client.
This project will make use of sockets to assist in networking. The
