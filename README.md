# Accord Chat



## How to Setup
You should run `$ make` and do one of the following:
* `$ ./server` if you want to host an accord server.
* `$ ./client <ip>` if you wish to connect to an accord server.

## Games
You can play two games in Accord which are accessed with their own in-chat command.
* Hangman: `!hangman`
* Reactor: `!react`

## Known Issues
If you exit out of server, sometimes the port will become unusable and thus you can not run the accord server again. In this case, simply type '$ killall accord-server' and the issue should be resolved.
